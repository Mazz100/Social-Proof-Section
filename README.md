### What I learned
In this project, I learned how to further combine Flex and Grid together and take advantage of both. I used Grid on the content inside of card items and played with align-items and margin to get the desired look. One more thing I learned is not to use excessive padding and margins, so I tried to refactor my code and make use of less of them.


### Continued development
I want to continue mixing flex and grid techniques and try discovering quicker and more efficient codes to lay down the design better and easier.


## Acknowledgments

This challenge was not as easy as others, I got a great assist from community mentors, learning one thing or two everytime. Thanks for the valuable tips and advice.
